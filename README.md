# pdga-score-scraper

Tool to grab hole-by-hole scores for PDGA tournaments

## Project Organization

Via the cookiecutter-data-science template:

<a target="_blank" href="https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/CCDS-Project%20template-328F97?logo=cookiecutter" />
</a>



## Procedure

* Determine `event_id` for event of interest via its report page:  `https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/{event_id}`
* Create virtual environment with specifications in `requirements.txt`.  Create virtual environment via Makefile command `make create_environment`.



## Included datasets
* 2025 Lost Valley Open
* 2025 Hoodoo (both Pro and Am days)




## TODO
* Extract hole pars from downloaded data rather than hardcode (notebook 2.01)
* More smartly handle environment creation (check if exists)
* Automate report creation with most relevant figures
* Create linear regression of hole scores vs player rating to see how "accurately" scores are given to differentiate players


## TODONE
* Export csv
* Random wait time between scrapes

Chuck Kennedy, allegedly:  A hole which yields > two-thirds or 70% the same score is an indicator of bad design.  (You want some variation to distinguish between the levels of the players.)
What is the Course Design group?
Perform analysis for ~50 point groups.  Maybe similar to by division.
Color level of courses?
